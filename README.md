# Word-Indexer
Project for Data Structures class - utilize a BST to create a word index for a large text file

## About

This project was built for CSC-151 / Data Structures. This course taught the fundamental data structures in computer science and associated algorithms.

## Project Description

At the end of most textbooks is an index that tells you on what pages you can find certain keywords. 
Most modern word processors can automatically create an index for you by scanning the text, picking out significant words, and 
keeping track of the pages on which those words occur.

#### Your Mission
Your assignment is to write a program that will automatically create such an index for any given text file.
